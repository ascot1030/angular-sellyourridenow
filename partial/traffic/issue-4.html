        <p>There's more NINJA crammed into this month's TPM than any month to-date! Marketing legend Dean "The Marketing Buddha" Jackson joins me, along with his in-house Facebook conversion and traffic expert Nate Mohr. However, this isn't just any old "Facebook traffic" tutorial video: this is the video that reveals EVERY STEP Dean and Nate take to generate (get this) 300% more clicks on their Facebook ads (including dissecting every word of their ad copy), PLUS how they are earning (get this) 300% ROI "minimum" on their ads. That means if they spend $100, they make $300 within 30 days. Now THAT is priceless information!</p>
        <p>Dean also covers as a bonus his famous "9-Word Email" that is so powerful it was written up in Success Magazine this month. We'll cover exactly what it is, and how you can use it to generate far more engagement, especially with 'dead' readers -- potentials on your list that haven't opened an email in over 90 days. The power of this 9-word email is literally worth years of your subscription price to TPM, so get out some paper and something to write with, and DIG IN. </p>
