        <p>This month's Traffic Pros features not only a traffic model, but also a legitimate biz-op model for creating simple websites that generate up to 10X ROI. In other words, for every dollar you spend on the site, from traffic to build, you can earn up to ten dollars. </p>
        <p>Keith Baxter is the world's foremost expert on building sites that capture 'existing' traffic to high-volume products, and leverages them to create a massive affiliate income stream. This is perfect if you do not have a product of your own, and you'll also find that your 3X VSL training will come in handy for many stages of this process. Keith goes into absolute detail on how to build these mini-sites on your own, all through outsourcing, down to the article content. It's the most hands-off yet high-dollar model I've seen for affiliates who want to leverage traffic to other products. </p>
        <p>Even if you're like me and have products of your own, you'll find this month's issue very rewarding, and yet another feather to add to your online financial cap!</p>
